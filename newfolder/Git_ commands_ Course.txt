-------Rewriting Git History - Amend, Reword, Delete, Reorder, Squash and Split ---------
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ElRzTuYln0M

** Git log --oneline (show the log of the repo as one line including commit message no thing else, no users , commit id ....etc)

** Amending commits
git commit --amend --no-edit (this means add the new files that staged and then the previous message commit will stay the same , just having a new ID)


** Rewording commits
git rebase -i HEAD~2
if you want to edit a commit message , choose reword (r) and then modify the commit message save that and check the log again

** Deleting commits


-------Rebase vs merge -------

git pull (bringing the latset from the master)
git checkout -b my_cool_feature (making a branch to develop my feature)

git add . 
git commit -m 'adding all staff'

**I need to check out again to master to see if is there any new upadtes and pull them
git checkout master
git pull

** I need to checkout to my branch and then rebase to the master
git checkout my_cool_feature
git rebase master

** I need to checkout to master and then rebase to my_cool_feature
git checkout master
git rebase my_cool_feature

I want to push all changes
git push


-- remote repo located on GitHUB.

* git --version
check the latest version of GIT
* touch <File name.extension>
create a file
*LS (list)
shows all files inside the file folder
-------setting the users that working with repo.-------
* Git init
initalize GIT as repository inside the desired folder
then you need to add your credentials to the repository
*Git config  -- global user.name 'Mouhammad'
* Git config  -- global user.email 'ktkoot88kh@gmail.com'
---------------------------------------------------------
* Git add <file>
will add specific file to the mentioned repository

* Git rm --cached <file name.extension>
will remove the file from staged, tracked file list to untracked file list
* Git add *.html (will add all files with HTML type to the repo)

* Git add . ( will add all files to the repo).

* GIT COMMIT (sending all your information/changes )

* clear :to clear the console
i (insert)
:wq (to commit your message)

* Git commit -m 'your commments will be shown without opening the emulator'

touch .gitignore (building a file that can ignore all the changes inside the folder even if I use add ., we use it normally to ignore log files).

* git log 
shows the log(commits that happened) of the file 


* Git reset
git log (choose which commit you will chose)
git reset --hard  2c4e793640c753(part of log id)

* Git diff "if it did not show any thing that means you have the same copy of the repo"(which part before) (same part)  which file 
 git diff HEAD~5 HEAD -- Pipelines/Build_Model_PHS.groovy

* git log -- author ="Mouhamad" // the use must be registreed other wise the result will show no thing if the user is not registered in the developer list

 * git diff --staged 
 comparing your staging area with your repo, beacuse when you make git diff it compares lokal copy with staging area, then when you add . statment
 Git put every thing to staging area and when you make git diff again (nothing will be shown) because there is no difference between staging area and lokal copy.
 
 * git rm first.txt "the name" 
 then you need directly to commit your changes to staging area

 * git mv first.txt pud.txt (move and rename are the same)
 renaming of file to other filename 
 
 * git commit --all -m "add your message"
 this statment is a commit and add statment in one statment
 
 *mkdir "name of the directory" 
 making new folder / adding new folder
 
 * git commit -am "add new changes and commit"
 add new changes and commit
 
 * git checkout -- index.html
 taking a copy of index.html file from the repo and replace the same file which is corrputed in my local copy.

********************
Git branch NAME"put the functionality that you will develop as name e.g login functionality"

(the idea of branch is to have a copy of the trunk and make a changes of it then add functionality to it then merge it to the trunk --OBS all the changes in the brnach will not affect the trunk until I merge the branch with the trunk) 
--- You need to checkout to the branch name after that to start doing your changes then merge them to the trunc.
Git merge 

* Git branch login (create a branch)
* Git checkout log (switch to that branch)
* Git merge login(merge the branch with trunc)




When dealing with server 

* Git push 
to remote server 
* Git pull 
pulling the latest changes that other programmer did 
* git clone 
take a copy of the repository
